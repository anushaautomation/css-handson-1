        <h3>What is CSS?</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>CSS stands for cascading style sheets.</li><br/>
            <li>CSS describbes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen,paper or in other media.</li><br/>
            <li><strong><span class="a">CSS is not necessary.</span><span class="c">CSS saves a lot of work</span>.</strong> it can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li><br/>
            <li><i><u>External style sheets are stored in CSS files.</u></i></li><br/>
        </ol>
        <h3>CSS can be added to HTML documents in 3 ways:</h3>
        <div></div>
        <ul>
            <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
            <li>Internal - by using a style element in the head section</li>
            <li>External - by using a link element to link to an externak CSS file.</li>
            <li>The most common way to add CSS,is to keep the styles in external CSS files.However,<span class="c" >in This<br/>
                tutorial we will use inline and internal styles,</span>because this is easier to demonstrate,and easier<br/>
                dor you to try it yourself.
            </li>
            </ul>
        <p>When comparing CSS class vs ID,the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements.ID,on the other hand,applies a style to one unique element.ID is also
            special in that you can use a special URL to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>In CSS,selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted,a style or set of styles can be applied to the
            element.
        </p>
        <p>There is a wide range of selectors available.Two of the most commonly used are class and ID.Both are used to target elements to which a style should be applied. </p>
